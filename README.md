### Project for a Bank Management System

The purpose of this straightforward **Bank Management System** is to mimic fundamental banking functions. The two main classes in the system are `user` and `bank`.


Basic user information, including name, age, and gender, is managed by the **User Class**. Additionally, it has a function (`showdetails()`) to show the user's personal data.
  
**Bank Class**: Derives from the `user` class and provides banking features such as using `deposite()` to deposit money, `withdraw()` to withdraw money, `viewbalance()` to view the balance of the account, and `transfer()` to send money to another user.

In order to ensure safe and easy banking administration, the system gives each user a unique account number and permits them to do tasks like depositing and withdrawing money (with a minimum limit of Rs. 1000), monitoring their balance, and transferring money to other users.

This project shows how to build a useful and interactive banking system using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts including inheritance, encapsulation, and class methods.
